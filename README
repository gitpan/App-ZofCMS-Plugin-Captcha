App-ZofCMS-Plugin-Captcha

The module is a plugin for L<App::ZofCMS> that provides means to generate and display
security images, known as "captchas" (i.e. protecting forms from bots).

The plugin was coded with idea that you will be using L<App::ZofCMS::Plugin::Session>
along with it to store the generated random string; however, it's not painfully
necessary to use Session plugin (just easier with it).
